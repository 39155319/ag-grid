<h1>External Filter</h1>

<p class="lead">
    External filtering allows you to mix your own 'outside of the grid' filtering with the grid's filtering.
</p>

<p>
    The example below shows external filters in action. There are two methods on <code>gridOptions</code> you
    need to implement: <code>isExternalFilterPresent()</code> and <code>doesExternalFilterPass(node)</code>.
</p>

<ul class="content">
    <li>
        <code>isExternalFilterPresent</code> is called exactly once every time the grid senses a filter change.
        It should return <code>true</code> if external filtering is active or <code>false</code> otherwise. If you
        return <code>true</code>, <code>doesExternalFilterPass()</code> will be called while filtering, otherwise
        <code>doesExternalFilterPass()</code> will not be called.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>doesExternalFilterPass</code> is called once for each row node in the grid. If you return <code>false</code>,
        the node will be excluded from the final set.
    </li>
</ul>

<note>
    If the external filter changes, you need to call <code>api.onFilterChanged()</code> to tell the grid.
