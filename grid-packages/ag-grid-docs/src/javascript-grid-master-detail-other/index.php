<h1 class="heading-enterprise">Master / Detail - Other</h1>

<p class="lead">
    Here we discuss areas of Master / Detail that didn't quite fit with the other sections within
    the documentation.
</p>


<h2>Syncing Detail Scrolling with Master</h2>

<p>
    By default, the Detail Grid takes up the width of the Master Grid and does not move when the Master Grid's
    columns are horizontally scrolled. This is because the Detail Grid is not sitting with the other Master Grid's
    cells, rather it is in a separate container that overlays the Master Grid's cells and takes up with full width
    of the grid ignoring all the Master Grid's columns.
</p>
<p>
    The underlying feature of the grid that allows the Detail Grid to span the width of the Master Grid is called
    <a href="../javascript-grid-full-width-rows/">Full Width Row</a>.
</p>

<p>
    It is possible to have the Detail Grid sit within the same container as the Master Grid's cells and hence move
    with the Master Grid's horizontal scrolling.
    This is achieved by 'Embedding the Full Width Row' and is set via the grid property <code>embedFullWidthRows=true</code>
    for the Master Grid. This tells the grid to layout (embed) the Detail Panel with the other rows.
</p>

<p>
    In the example below, notice that horizontal scrolling is combined for both Master Grid and Detail Grid using
    the Embed Full Width Rows feature.
</p>

<?= grid_example('Detail scrolls with Master', 'detail-scrolls-with-master', 'generated', ['enterprise' => true, 'exampleHeight' => 525, 'modules'=>['clientside', 'masterdetail', 'menu', 'columnpanel']]) ?>

<p>
    If you are mixing Embed Full Width Rows and
    <a href="../javascript-grid-master-detail-custom-detail/">Custom Detail</a>, then be aware the Detail Panel
    will get rendered three times as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pinned Left Columns</li>
    <li>Pinned Right Columns</li>
    <li>Pinned Centre Columns</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is because the Columns, and thus the Detail Panel, are appearing in three separate scrollable sections.
    The example below demonstrates this. Note the custom Detail Panel appears in all three sections.
</p>

<?= grid_example('Embed Custom Detail', 'embed-custom-detail', 'generated', ['enterprise' => true, 'modules'=>['clientside', 'masterdetail']]) ?>

<p>
    If you want your custom Detail Panel to only show content in one section, have logic that inspects the components
    <code>params.pinned</code> property and renders content relevant for the section.
</p>

<h2>Filtering and Sorting</h2>

<p>
    There are no specific configurations for filtering and sorting with Master / Detail but as there are multiple grids
    each grid will filter and sort independently.
</p>

<p>
    Below shows a simple Master / Detail setup which has filtering and sorting enabled in both master and detail grids.
</p>

<?= grid_example('Filtering with Sort', 'filtering-with-sort', 'generated', ['enterprise' => true, 'exampleHeight' => 550, 'modules'=>['clientside', 'masterdetail', 'menu', 'setfilter', 'columnpanel', 'filterpanel']]) ?>



<h2>Exporting Master / Detail Data</h2>

<p>
    By default, exporting the master grid will just export the master rows. If you want to export detail rows, you can
    configure the <code>getCustomContentBelowRow</code> callback to generate a representation of the detail row that will
    be inserted below the master rows in the in the export. See the
    <a href="../javascript-grid-export/">export documentation</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
    There is an important difference between rendering and exporting Master / Detail content. When you expand a master
    row in the UI, a new instance of the Grid is created to render the detail, meaning that you have the full power of
    the Grid to sort, filter and format the detail data.
</p>
<p>
    When exporting, the original data object representing
    the row is passed to <code>getCustomContentBelowRow</code> which returns styled content to be inserted into the
    export. No instance of the Grid is created. This means that export performance is good even with large Master /
    Detail data sets. However, if your <code>detailGridOptions</code> contains value getters, value formatters,
    sorting, filtering etc, and you want these to appear in the export, they must be applied by
    <code>getCustomContentBelowRow</code>.
</p>

<note>
    Since detail grids are full Grid instances, triggering an export through the right-click context menu on
    a detail grid will do a normal export for the detail grid only. If this is not appropriate for your application
    you can disable the export item in the context menu, or replace it with a custom item that triggers an export on
    the master grid.
</note>

<p>
    The example below demonstrate how both master and detail data can be exported.
</p>

<?= grid_example('Exporting Master / Detail Data', 'exporting', 'generated', ['enterprise' => true, 'exampleHeight' => 550, 'modules'=>['clientside', 'masterdetail', 'menu', 'columnpanel', 'clipboard', 'excel']]) ?>

<h2>Supported Modes</h2>

<p>
    The Master / Detail feature organises the grid in a way which overlaps with other features.
    For this reason, Master / Detail does not work with certain grid configurations. These
    configurations are as follows:
</p>


<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">Tree Data</p>

<p>
    Master / Detail is not supported with <a href="../javascript-grid-tree-data">Tree Data</a>.
    This is because the concept of tree data conflicts with Master / Detail, in that in tree
    data, any row can expand to show child rows, which would result in a clash when a row
    has child rows in addition to having Master / Detail at the same row.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">Layouts</p>

<p>
    It is not possible to mix <a href="../javascript-grid-width-and-height/#dom-layout">DOM layout</a>
    for master detail. This is because the layout is a CSS setting that would be inherited by all
    grids contained with the master grid. So if your master grid was 'for-print', then all child grids
    would pick up the 'for-print' layout.
</p>

<p>
    When using Master / Detail and <a href="../javascript-grid-for-print/">for-print</a>,
    then all detail grids need to use for-print.
</p>

<p>
    When using Master / Detail and <a href="../javascript-grid-width-and-height/#auto-height">auto-height</a>,
    then all detail grids need to use auto-height.
</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">Range Selection</p>

<p>
    When <a href="../angular-grid-range-selection/">Range Selection</a> is enabled on the Master Grid,
    the Detail Grid will not participate in the Range Selection of the Master Grid.
